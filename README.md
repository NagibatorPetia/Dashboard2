#Dashboard

This is a site that can work both online and offline. The "filling" of the site is very diverse and complex, as it might seem at first glance.

Thanks to the function by which the site can work offline, all the data that you have ever entered during the month will remain on this site, and you can continue to work with them

#To start working with the Site you need:

1. Good knowledge of HTML-5, JavaScript, CSS

2. Access to the terminal (console), stable Internet(For the first time)

3. Application for editing code.

4. Access to the Git library and Workbox library

5. A lot of time (For tests and work)

First you need to download the code, for this open the terminal and enter this command: git clone https://github.com/NagibatorPetia/Dashboardr.git

Enter this command in the terminal:
npm install
npm run --silent start

Open the browser tab for http://localhost:**** (**** - your server address, 8081 for example)

Congratulations, you got access to the site and its server!
